# Information
## What is the Miniforest Foundation?
The Miniforest Foundation is an organization created by Module64 (real name hidden for privacy purposes). Our mission is to strive for a better planet by encouraging people to plant more trees and contribute to their environment, especially by promoting the idea of Miyawaki Forests.
## What's a Miyawaki forest?
Miyawaki forests are a "type" of forest created by a Japanese botanist named Akira Miyawaki. It's a famous technique used in urban areas to introduce new habitats and benefit the environment. The way it works is by creating "mini-forests," which are like dense forests the size of tennis fields. These forests have great benefits, a few of which include reduced soil erosion and lesser amounts of flooding.
## Who created the Miniforest Foundation?
The Miyawaki Foundation was originally created by Module64 after he was looking at trees while he was picking for apples. He thought, "hm. Why not team up with my friends to bring awareness to the Miyawaki method as well as saving the environment in general?" That's... not usually a thought most people have while picking for apples. But, here we are now: we've made the website and that's that.
## Why did you make this website's code public?
Because open-source software is **COOL**. Boom.

Thanks for finding this repository and taking the time to look through it a bit. Hopefully reading our README as well as potentially checking out our website gave you a better understanding of what our organization is and *maybe*, just maybe even encouraged you to [contribute to our foundation](https://miniforest.coefficient.repl.co/contribute).
